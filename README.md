## Corpus Comparison

This repository contains an overview of the document intersections of language resources. It is described in the following paper:

> Chantal van Son, Oana Inel, Roser Morante, Lora Aroyo and Piek Vossen (2018). Resource Interoperability for Sustainable Benchmarking: The Case of Events. In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), Miyazaki, Japan. [pdf](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L18-1178)

- The EventStatus Corpus ([LDC2017T09](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017T09))
- The Language Understanding (LU) Annotation Corpus ([LDC2009T10](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2009T10))

Note that for all multilingual resources, only the English parts have been taken into account. 

For the Penn Treebank and PropBank I have used the [`ptb` package](http://www.nltk.org/howto/corpus.html) from NLTK to obtain all filenames contained in the corpora. For all other corpora, the analysis is based on the files in the `data/filelists` folder specifying all files contained in the corpora. Most of them can be directly downloaded from the LDC website (if you are a member of LDC) or are included in the distributions. Some of them were generated by me, others were kindly send to me by the creators of the corpora. 

### Content

This repository contains the following:

- `data/filelists`: This folder contains the files specifying all filenames (sometimes with the complete path) contained in each corpus. 
- `data/mappings.csv`: This file maps the original filenames (or filepaths) to the uniform filenames that have been used to analyse the intersections.
- `data/intersections.csv`: This file uses a binary encoding for representing the intersections of the corpora. It can loaded into the UpSet visualization tool (see below).
- `data/upset.json`: This `json` file describes the data contained in `intersections.csv` and is used to load it into the UpSet Web Version (see below).

### UpSet Visualization

The intersections of the corpora can be visualized using [UpSet](http://caleydo.org/tools/upset/). There are multiple ways to use the UpSet visualization tool:

1. [UpSet Web Version](http://vcg.github.io/upset):  For an interactive visualization, go to the UpSet Web Version, choose `Load Data` and paste the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChantalvanSon/CorpusComparison/master/data/upset.json
2. [UpSetR Shiny App](https://gehlenborglab.shinyapps.io/upsetr/) For a static visualization, go to the UpSetR Shiny App and upload [this document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChantalvanSon/CorpusComparison/master/data/intersections.csv) (can be found under `data`).
3. [UpSetR](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/UpSetR): Install the UpSetR package in R and create the plot using [this document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChantalvanSon/CorpusComparison/master/data/intersections.csv) (can be found under `data`).
4. [pyUpSet](https://github.com/ImSoErgodic/py-upset): Install pyUpSet in Python to create the plot; this will need some more pre-processing and the visualizations are not as nice as the other methods.
